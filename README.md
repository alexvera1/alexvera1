I'm a full-stack software engineer with 1+ years of experience programming in JavaScript,Python, React and MERN stack. I completed General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp. Prior to that, I studied public health at San Francisco State University. Through extensive self-study and practical application, I have acquired a solid understanding of software development principles, programming languages, and web development. I'm driven to expand my skills through targeted mentorship, challenging projects, and continuing to grow my career in tech.
